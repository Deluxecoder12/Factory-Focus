# Smart Factory Machine Monitoring and Optimization with C#, SQL, KPI Dev, Grafana, Ignition, and CI/CD

## Project Goal: 

Develop a system to monitor and optimize machine performance in a factory setting. This system will collect data from machines, store
it in a database, generate KPIs to track performance, visualize the data in Grafana and Ignition dashboards, and implement a CI/CD
pipeline for automated deployment.

## Technologies Used:

### C# .Net:

Develop a data acquisition application to collect sensor data from machines using communication protocols like OPC UA or Modbus.

### SQL Database:

Store the collected sensor data in a relational database like SQL Server or MySQL. Design tables to store machine information, sensor 
data timestamps, and readings.

### KPI Dev:

Develop Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to track machine health and performance. Examples include Overall Equipment Effectiveness
(OEE), downtime percentage, production rate, and energy consumption.

### Grafana:

Create dashboards to visualize the collected data and KPIs. Use Grafana's rich features to create charts, graphs, and alerts for anomalies.

### Ignition SCADA:

Develop an Ignition SCADA dashboard to provide a real-time view of machine status, sensor readings, and trends. Ignition's drag-and-drop interface allows for easy visualization customization.

### CI/CD Pipeline:

Implement a CI/CD pipeline using tools like Jenkins or Azure DevOps to automate the build, test, and deployment process for your C# application and Grafana dashboards. This ensures consistent and efficient updates to the system.

## Project Phases:

### Data Acquisition:

Develop the C# application to collect sensor data from machines. Configure communication protocols and data parsing logic.

### Database Design:

Design and implement the SQL database schema to store machine information, sensor data, and timestamps.

### KPI Development: 

Develop KPIs using KPI Dev tools to track machine performance.

### Grafana Dashboarding:

Design dashboards in Grafana to visualize sensor data, KPIs, and trends. Utilize Grafana alerting features for anomalies.

### Ignition SCADA Dashboard:

Design an Ignition dashboard to display real-time machine status, sensor readings, and historical trends.

### CI/CD Pipeline Implementation:

Implement a CI/CD pipeline to automate the build, test, and deployment process for the C# application and Grafana dashboards.

## Benefits:

### Improved machine monitoring and diagnostics.

### Data-driven insights for optimizing production processes.

### Real-time visualization of machine health and performance.

### Automated deployment for faster updates and reduced downtime.

## Additional Considerations:

### Implement security measures to protect the data acquisition application and database.

### Design the system for scalability to accommodate additional machines and data sources.

### Consider integrating machine learning algorithms for predictive maintenance.

##### This project idea provides a comprehensive use case for the technologies you mentioned. You can customize it further based on specific needs and functionalities.
