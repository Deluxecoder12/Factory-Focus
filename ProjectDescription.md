# Personal Laptop Performance Monitoring System with C# .NET, SQL, KPI Dev, Grafana, and GitHub Actions

## Project Goal

Simulate a real-world industrial monitoring system by developing a scaled-down version focused on one's laptop's performance. This project will involve collecting data using C#, storing it in a SQL database, developing KPIs to track performance, and visualizing the data in Grafana dashboards. Additionally, explore the implementation of a CI/CD pipeline for potential future scalability.

## Technologies Used

### C# .Net

Develop a data acquisition application using C# .NET libraries like System.ManagementObjectSearcher and PerformanceCounter to collect data on CPU usage, memory consumption, disk space, and network activity.

### SQL Database

Implement a local SQL database to store the collected performance data for analysis and visualization.

### KPI Dev

Utilize KPI development tools to define and calculate relevant KPIs including Overall Equipment Effectiveness
(OEE), downtime percentage, production rate, and energy consumption.

### Grafana

Create dashboards to visualize the collected data and KPIs.

### CI/CD Pipeline

Implement a CI/CD pipeline using GitLab CI/CD to automate the build, test, and deployment process.

## Benefits

Improved machine monitoring and diagnostics.
Data-driven insights for optimizing production processes.
Real-time visualization of machine health and performance.
Automated deployment for faster updates and reduced downtime.

## Additional Considerations

Implement security measures to protect the data acquisition application and database.
Design the system for scalability to accommodate additional machines and data sources.
Consider integrating machine learning algorithms for predictive maintenance.
